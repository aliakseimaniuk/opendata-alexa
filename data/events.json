This heartbreaking, funny, and inspirational story is about mentorship, life, love, kids, baseball, and everyday heroism in oakland and havana today. Two extraordinary youth baseball coaches: a 61yearold afrocuban, who coaches in a havana neighborhood that is rich in community but struggling desperately economically, and a 46yearold africanamerican man who coaches in a troubled oakland neighborhood wracked by three decades of gang violence. The filmmaker introduces the coaches and the oakland coach vows he will take his players to cuba to play the havana team one day. Two years of us/cuba sanctions and red tape later, he and nine players fly to havana. For the next week, the boys and coaches eat, dance, swim, argue, tease, and play baseball together. The streetsmart ghost town boys gradually warm to the funloving friendship of their afrocuban hosts. Real friendships form and then a fateful phone call reveals a tragedy that has taken place back home on an oakland street.",
